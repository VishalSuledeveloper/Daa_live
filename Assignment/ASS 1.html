            Design and implement Binary search algorithm using Divide and Conquer method for a given input.
             Determine the time required to search an element. Determine the time required to search an element 
             for large values of n. Compare the time taken by Binary Search with the time taken by linear search. 
             Modify the binary search by dividing it using a random number in the appropriate range. Show how this 
             Modified algorithm compares with the original algorithm in terms of Performance.
