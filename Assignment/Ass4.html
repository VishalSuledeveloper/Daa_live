            Suppose we have a set of coins of denominations Cn-1, Cn-2,......C0 for some C>1. 
            Coins of each denominations are available unlimited quantity. The problem is to make up an exact amount 
            A using a minimum total number of coins. Device a solution for this problem and analyze the time complexity 
            of the algorithm.
